            <p>As a college student studying cybersecurity, I have the great pleasure of taking multiple programming classes, and this semester I happen to be taking Data Structures and Algorithms. I currently finished the second-to-last program, and we went over what the last program would be today, so I feel like I have liberty to discuss this class.<br><br>This class used C, just wanted to get the out of the way.<br><br> This class taught me different data structures in C like structs and linked lists, along with some sorting and searching algorithms. Although the programming language we used in this class was C I feel I can easily implement the things I learned in other programming languages.<br><br> I will try to briefly teach some of the things I learned in this class. Maybe someone will see this and benefit from it, but mainly it helps me retain what I learned. They say teaching is the best way to learn. Here is what I will cover:
               <br><br><ul>
                  <li>Pointers and pointer arithmetic</li>
                  <li>Structs</li>
                  <li>Allocating data with Malloc</li>
                  <li>Recursion</li>
                  <li>Sorting</li>
                  <li>Searching algorithms</li>
                  <li>Linked lists</li>
                  <li>Writing clean code</li>
               </ul><br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="sub-header">Pointers</p><br>
            <p>
               Pointers are only in select few programming languages, such as C and C++. Pointers are used to manipulate the data of a program at the low levels, enabling the ability to get the best performance and nick-picky you need. But mainly they are used to refer to the same space in memory from multiple locations.<br><br>
