            <p>This is a question I asked myself not too long ago. I was into the idea of making websites for people, but I didn’t know if Webflow was what I wanted to do. Here I’ll hope to help you answer the same question.</p><br>
            <p class="sub-header" >Why I learned Webflow</p><br>
            <p>When I was first interested in making websites, I looked into Webflow. I'll admit I believed in a "get rich quick" solution in web development and I would be one of the few to find it. I thougth Webflow was it, so I tried it. Long story short, I realized Webflow too had its own mastery system and I wasn't sure I wanted to make the investment.</p><br>
            <p class="sub-header">Webflow vs Code</p><br>
            <p>Webflow is a no-code website-builder that is a middle ground in between template services like Squarespace and actually coding your own website.  </p><br>
            <p>There are many people who make a living making Webflow websites, and good for them. Webflow has as much complexity as you can give it, making beautiful websites without code like <a href="https://www.wysemeter.com" target="_blank">this one</a>. A good way to compare Webflow with actual coding is:</p><br>
            <p class="block-quote" >Webflow can create beautiful websites, while code can create any web app you want.</p><br>
            <p>Any company needs a website. A traditional website is where companies will try to get your attention, give you a basic rundown of their services, and then some information about how to contact them. A web app is an application that is hosted on the web. Some examples of a web app could be a booking system, chess game, or weather app. Webflow does not have the ability to make web apps. You can, however, integrate third-party APIs and services into Webflow, like a booking system, but they usually have limited customization and sometimes aren’t able to be designed to fit into the theme and style of your website</p><br>
            <p>In a recend update to Webflow, e-commerce integration was added, which allowed Webflow developers to create online stores natively in Webflow. Webflow is a fairly new service, so it could be getting more functionality with future updates.</p><br>
            <p class="sub-header" >What I learned using Webflow</p><br>
            <p>
               I did Webflow for a couple months then realized it has some shortcomings that actual code doesn’t have. Webflow might be easier to start with but in the long run, to make functional web apps, you’ll need to learn how to code.<br><br>

               My Webflow timeline was going great. I was enjoying designing websites and making them in Webflow, until I needed extra functionality. A website I was planning was going to need a way for people to set up appointments for rides. It needed to have a calendar API and automatically handle scheduling conflicts and determine the length of the rides, if a driver was available, be able to notify people, and many other variables. I looked around but I would end up using multiple third-party services to have to make this work. I wanted to give my client the most streamlined option, so that’s when I decided to switch over to coding, where I could make my own application to handle everything. Even though I was a beginner at web development, this project had time until it was due. I had plenty of time to learn before needing to code up this website. <br><br>Learing Webflow was definitely not time wasted, however. It helped me learn a lot about HTML and CSS and how the structure of the website should fit together. It was a great introduction to the box model and many other HTML and CSS principles. </p><br>
            <p class="sub-header">Conclusion</p><br>
            <p>The answer to the question “should you learn Webflow or coding?” comes down to what you eventually want to end up doing. If you are more focused on the designing side, and you want to make simple yet good-looking websites with minimal functionality, go for Webflow. If you want to be a developer, or programmer, and want to make useful web apps and complex programs that do whatever you tell them, learn coding. </p>
