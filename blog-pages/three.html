            <p>Quick plug. To demostrate what I learned, and also to help me retain what I learned, I am going to be writing a blog series going over the main things I learned from the class called Data Structs. The series will be a total of three posts:</p><br>
            <ol>
               <li>Pointers and Pointer Arithmetic in C</li>
               <li>Arrays, Structs, and Linked Lists</li>
               <li>Searching & Sorting Algorithms Made Easy</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p class="sub-header">My Experience</p><br>
            <p>As a college student studying cybersecurity, I have pleasure of taking multiple programming classes, and this semester I added a second programming class to my arsenal--Data Structures and Algorithms. I took this class as a beginner / early intermediate in coding in general, but now I feel confident enough to call myself an intermediate in both programming and the C language.</p><br>
            <p>At my college, Data Structs had a reputation among the computing majors, and it was all due to the teacher of that class. If there was ever drill sergeant in the form of a coding teacher, it would be this guy. The first words that ever came out of his mouth were, "I just want to get this out of the way--everything you've ever heard about me is true". He had a very strict grading style which was a big learning curve above my previous programming class. I'll admit the first two or three programs were a struggle--not just because the actual logic was pushing my brain, but because I never knew a program that looked flawless in my mind could get marked off so many times! I always ended up realizing that it, in fact, was not a flawless program.</p><br>
            <p>I came out of that class knowing a lot more about C but also about the importance of clean code, clear comments, and clear variable names. Now my code looks very professional. Looking back on my old programs arises some cringe, and sometimes watching Youtube videos, I silenty wish the code was a little clearer. This class also increased my comfort with using pointers, calling functions different ways, exception handling, using Linux, and just logic in general.</p><br>
            <p>In terms of data structures and algorithms, this class taught me different data structures in C like structs, arrays, and linked lists, along with some sorting and searching algorithms. Although the programming language in the class was C I feel I can easily implement the things I learned in other programming languages. For example, I recently made a search feature for my blog (which you probably already noticed.)</p><br>
            <p>If you're wondering whether you should study data structures and algorithms, I'd highly recommend it. I think it's one class every programmer should take, escpecially if you're self-taught. Any form of class, Youtube videos, or books will be of great help. It's said that the core of computer science centers around all sorts of data structures and algorithms.</p><br>
